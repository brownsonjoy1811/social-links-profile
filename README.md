## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- View a glass-effect profile card with an animated background


### Links

- Live Site URL: [my social links profile](https://brownsonjoy1811.github.io/social-links-profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Glassmorphism effect
- Keyframe animations for background effects

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement a **glassmorphism effect** using `backdrop-filter` and how to create a subtle animated background with `@keyframes`. Hereâ€™s a snippet showcasing the glass effect:

```css
.profile-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

I also improved my understanding of hover effects for buttons, making them feel more interactive.

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:

- Experiment with 3D animations using CSS and JavaScript.
- Improve accessibility by ensuring proper color contrast and keyboard navigation.
- Explore using CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap for faster styling.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Glassmorphism](https://css-tricks.com/glassmorphism-with-css/) - Helped me understand the glass effect better.
- [MDN Docs - CSS Keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) - Useful for animating the background smoothly.
